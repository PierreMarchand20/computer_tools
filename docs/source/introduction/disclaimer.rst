Before reading the content of this document, you should be aware that

- I have studied very little computer science and informatics in my undergraduate studies. Most of what I know now comes from self-learning, and practice. If you disagree, or if you think there is a better way than what I will present, please share your ideas and contribute to this document!
- The target audience for this document is people who have also studied very little computer science and informatics, but still need to code.
- *A workflow is personal*, meaning that what I present may not be entirely adequate to your own way of reasoning. But I hope it can inspire you to think about your workflow, and that it can give you ideas on how to make it more efficient.
- The tools I will present are maintained and well-documented at the time of writing, so I will focus on what they can bring you and refer to their documentation for installation and more technical discussions.
- For those doing theoretical research, I should point out that *writing a* :math:`\LaTeX` *document* is coding.
